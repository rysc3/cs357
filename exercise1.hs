1. Features of Haskell 
-- lazy evaluation, pattern matching, currying, lambda expressions, 

2. Function application 
-- in Haskell, function application is denoted by a space, not parentheses
-- emphasis on currying n shit.

3. Prelude 
-- Prelude is a module that is imported by default into every Haskell program.

4. Types 
-- Bool, Char, String, Int, Float/double

5. Lists 
-- can have an infinite 

6. Typles 
-- Tuples are finite ordered sequences of values, whhich can hold up to 20 ish elements

7. Functions 
-- Pattern matching is a way of matching values against patterns and, if the value conforms to the pattern, extracting components of the value.
-- generally we use lambdas when we can keep it below 20 characters, otherwise make a normal function

8. Currying
-- Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes just a single argument and returns another function if any arguments are still needed.
